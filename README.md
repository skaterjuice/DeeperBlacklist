# DeeperBlacklist

## Overview

Small but powerful blacklist + wildcards.

## How to use?

1. Download the file with the name *Deeper Blacklist + Wildcads, Onion, Torrent.txt* to your local machine. 
2. Login into your Deeper device. Select Security -> User Config -> Blacklist -> Import and upload the downloaded *.txt* file.


## Caution

This is a general list, please check wildcards to make sure you will not block needed access to local region sites. 
For example, .CN or .RU.


## Torrent Tracker

Deeper Connect devices already have a Bit Torrent blocker and a tracker blocker, but for anyone who wants an extra added layer of protection, you can add this list to the Blacklist.
