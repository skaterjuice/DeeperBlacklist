## How to use?

1. Download the file with the name *New List 2025* to your local machine. 
2. Login into your Deeper device. Select Security -> User Config -> Blacklist -> Import and upload the downloaded *.txt* file.



## Torrent Tracker

Deeper Connect devices already have a Bit Torrent blocker and a tracker blocker, but for anyone who wants an extra added layer of protection, you can add this list to the Blacklist.
